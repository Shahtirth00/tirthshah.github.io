									<h2>My Journey</h2>
									<p>My academic journey has been a thrilling roller-coaster ride, packed with exciting projects and enriching experiences. One significant twist in my journey was my selection for a project engineer position at Wipro, one of India's leading IT companies. Despite being thrilled about this opportunity, the onboarding process never happened due to the recession period. This setback was challenging, but it motivated me to come back stronger and more determined. I used this experience as a stepping stone to further my education and skills, ultimately leading me to pursue my Master of Information Systems. </p>
